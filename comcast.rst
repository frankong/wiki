How to set up Comcast modem
============================

1. Disconnect the old cable modem completely.
2. Connect the new cable modem to the coax, power and ethernet connections.
3. Reboot your router (or computer if you have no router).
4. On your computer go to any website.  With a new modem, you will likely be redirected to a "walled garden" page which will have instructions to register the modem, simply follow the instructions.
5. If the above fails (it can be very touchy in some areas), call Comcast (1-800-COMCAST) and have them register the new modem directly over the phone.  This takes about 5-10 minutes.
6. After the new modem is working properly, return the rental modem to Comcast and make sure you get a receipt, just in case there are any questions or misunderstandings down the road about whether you returned the modem or not.
